# oh-my-zsh

**Objectives**

* Use oh-my-zsh rather than defining your own git aliases!
* enable git plugin
* How to learn git on the go

## Intro

```shell
echo $SHELL
```
Make sure you have Z shell first, which is a powerful shell that is [mostly] compatible with Bash.

`oh-my-zsh` is  nothing but an instant enhancements and a framework for making zsh more useful!

> [!TIP]
>
> You can learn how to install [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) here.

Pick plugins from [the plugin Wiki page](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Plugins), however we are mostly interested in [the git plugin](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git).

Example aliases:

| Alias  | Command                   |
| ------ | ------------------------- |
| `g`    | git                       |
| `gccd` | git clone & cd            |
| `grt`  | cd to the repository root |

### Another nice plugin

You don't need to memorise them, you can learn them on the go, using [zsh-you-should-use](https://github.com/MichaelAquilina/zsh-you-should-use)
